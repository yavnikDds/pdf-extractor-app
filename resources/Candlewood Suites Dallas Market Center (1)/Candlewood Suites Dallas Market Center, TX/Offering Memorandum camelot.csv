DALLAS-FORT WORTH
"The Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex is the fourth-most populous metro in the nation, with an"
"aggregate of 7.9 million residents. It is composed of 13 counties, stretching nearly 10,000 square"
"miles. The core cities of Dallas and Fort Worth house approximately 1.4 million and 990,000"
"residents, respectively. Strong corporate relocations and the resulting job gains continue to draw"
"new residents to the region, which has added more than 315,000 more people since the onset"
"of the COVID-19 health crisis. In keeping with historical trends, Collin and Denton counties have"
"received the majority of growth. To accommodate the additional roadway traffic, the region’s"
transportation network is continually evolving. The expansion of the transportation network is vital
"to supporting the substantial developments in housing, retail and industrial, allowing commuters"
to access the metro’s numerous corporations and expanding array of industries.
