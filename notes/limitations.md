- Tabula simply isn’t built to automatically handle multi-line or merged headers well.
- Tabula itself can’t reliably detect merged or multi-line headers automatically.

- Since Tabula doesn't offer a fully automated parameter to fix merged headers, your alternatives include:
    Camelot: Often performs better with complex table structures. Try both flavor="lattice" and flavor="stream".
    pdfplumber: Extracts table data as raw text, allowing algorithmic header detection.
